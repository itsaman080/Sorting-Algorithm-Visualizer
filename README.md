# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer

The Sorting Visualizer project is an interactive tool designed to showcase various sorting algorithms in action. Through an intuitive user interface, users can select a sorting algorithm of their choice, set the size of the array to be sorted, and witness the step-by-step process of sorting. As the algorithm progresses, the tool visually represents how elements are rearranged, providing a clear and engaging demonstration of each algorithm's behavior.

Key functions include:

Algorithm Selection: Users can choose from a range of sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and more.
Array Generation: The tool generates random or customizable arrays of varying sizes, enabling users to observe how algorithms perform under different conditions.
Visualization: As the chosen algorithm runs, the tool visually animates each step of the sorting process, allowing users to see how elements are swapped and repositioned.
Speed Control: Users can adjust the speed of the animation, enabling them to slow down or speed up the sorting process for better comprehension.
Educational Insight: The Sorting Visualizer serves as an educational resource, helping users understand the fundamental principles behind sorting algorithms and their varying efficiency.
